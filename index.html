            <h2>About Raiden</h2>
            <p> Raiden is cool and does sword stuff. He used to be a child soldier and later joined a special group called Foxhound. During a mission, he learned 
                about the patriots and their plans to control the media. After that, I'm not really sure what he did. MGS4 is stuck on the PS3 so I can't play it
                becasue Sony wanted to create a complicated super computer instead of a gaming console. After MGS4, he does some funnys and fights the senator of 
                Colorado and a couple of other funny guys. He was also raised by Snake's clone, Solidus Snake, who wanted to destroy the patriots.
